# System Patterns

## Architecture Overview
The library follows a component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Core Components
1. Form Container
   - Manages form state
   - Handles form submission
   - Coordinates validation
   - Manages field updates

2. Field Components
   - Handle individual form fields
   - Manage field-level validation
   - Control field rendering
   - Handle field-specific logic

3. Widget System
   - Provides UI components for different field types
   - Supports custom widget registration
   - Handles platform-specific rendering

## Key Design Patterns

### 1. Component Composition
- Uses React's component composition for form structure
- Enables nested form fields
- Allows for widget customization

### 2. State Management
- Uses React hooks for local state
- Implements controlled components pattern
- Maintains single source of truth for form data

### 3. Type System
- Leverages TypeScript for type safety
- Uses JSON Schema type definitions
- Provides strong typing for form data and events

### 4. Testing Strategy
- Jest for unit testing
- React Testing Library for component testing
- Test coverage requirements
- Integration test support

## File Structure
```
src/
├── fields/          # Field type implementations
├── widgets/         # UI components for fields
├── types/          # TypeScript definitions
├── utils/          # Helper functions
└── __tests__/      # Test files
```

## Development Patterns

### Code Style
- ESLint for code linting
- Prettier for code formatting
- TypeScript strict mode
- Consistent file naming

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for utilities
- Component tests for widgets
- Integration tests for form behavior
- Minimum 80% coverage

### Build Process
- TypeScript compilation
- Babel transformation
- Jest test runner
- npm scripts for common tasks
